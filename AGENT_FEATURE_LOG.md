# Agent Feature Log

This file is the repository's running implementation history for agent-assisted work.

## Working rule

- Read this file before making any change in this repository.
- After completing work, add a dated entry describing what changed and how it was verified.
- State whether a database migration is required and name it when applicable.
- Keep entries concise, factual, and limited to this repository.

## Entries

### 2026-09-28 - Retest Supabase database connectivity

- Verified the corrected `DATABASE_URL` has the asyncpg driver, complete direct Supabase host, port `5432`, database name, username, and a populated password without exposing secret values.
- Verified the authenticated Supabase API request still succeeds.
- The read-only PostgreSQL check reached connection setup but failed DNS resolution because the direct Supabase database endpoint requires IPv6 in this environment; use the project's Session Pooler connection string for IPv4 access.
- Verification: Supabase API passed; database `SELECT 1` was not reached because direct-host DNS resolution failed.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Validate Supabase connectivity configuration

- Confirmed the ignored local environment contains all three required Supabase variables without exposing their values.
- Verified an authenticated request to the configured Supabase API succeeds.
- The read-only PostgreSQL `SELECT 1` check could not start because the configured `DATABASE_URL` is malformed with an empty port; the URL must be replaced with a complete single-line connection string.
- Verification: Supabase API passed; database URL parsing failed before any database connection was attempted.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Make database configuration Supabase-only

- Removed the local `POSTGRES_*` fallback fields from application settings, `.env.example`, and the ignored local `.env` file.
- Made `DATABASE_URL` the single PostgreSQL connection setting alongside the Supabase project URL and backend secret key.
- Added a regression test confirming that no localhost/PostgreSQL-host fallback remains.
- Verification: 3 pytest tests passed; mypy reported no issues in 29 source files; Python byte-compilation and `git diff --check` passed.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Add local Supabase configuration placeholders

- Added blank `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, and `DATABASE_URL` placeholders to `.env.example`.
- Created the ignored local `.env` file with the same blank placeholders for developer-supplied secrets.
- Verification: confirmed `.env` exists locally, is ignored by Git, and contains no secret values; `git diff --check` passed.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-28 - Establish the FastAPI architecture foundation

- Added the `entities -> app -> interface/infrastructure` package structure based on Shadow's practical clean architecture, adapted for the InkFig domain.
- Added a FastAPI application factory, configurable CORS and `/api/v1` prefix, root and versioned health endpoints, environment template, PostgreSQL-ready dependencies, test/type-check configuration, and architecture documentation.
- Reserved organized locations for DTOs, enums, exceptions, repository ports, services, routes, controllers, dependencies, middleware, SQLAlchemy models, repositories, integrations, and timestamped migrations.
- Verification: 2 pytest tests passed; mypy reported no issues in 29 source files; Python byte-compilation and `git diff --check` passed.
- Migration required: No. The migrations directory is structural only.

### 2026-09-28 - Document the InkFig product vision

- Added `README.md` with the project's university context, art-community purpose, planned discovery and interaction features, AI-assisted image search, teacher event moderation workflow, and access-control direction.
- Clarified that this repository owns InkFig's main business features and workflows.
- Verification: reviewed the rendered Markdown structure and ran Git's whitespace validation.
- Migration required: No.

### 2026-09-27 - Initialize agent feature log

- Added this repository-level feature log and established the read-before-work and update-after-work convention.
- Verification: confirmed the file exists in the repository.
- Migration required: No.

## 2026-09-28 - Standardize agent feature log requirements

### Request

Require every repository to use a root `AGENT_FEATURE_LOG.md`, read it fully before each ticket, preserve its history, and append every completed ticket using the prescribed structured sections.

### Changes

- Renamed the existing root feature log to the exact uppercase filename while preserving all previous entries unchanged.
- Adopted the required entry format for this and all future tickets.
- Intentionally left application behavior, authorization, APIs, database configuration, and dependencies unchanged.

### Repositories

- `delivery-main-system`: standardized the root feature-log filename and adopted the structured ticket record.
- `delivery-user-system`: standardized the root feature-log filename and adopted the structured ticket record.
- `delivery-user-FE`: standardized the root feature-log filename and adopted the structured ticket record.

### Files

- `AGENT_FEATURE_LOG.md`: renamed from `agent_feature_log.md` and appended this structured entry.

### API

No API changes.

### Database

No migration required.

### Permissions and scope

- No permissions or role access changed.
- No organization or domain scope changed.
- Backend authorization behavior is unchanged.

### Frontend

No frontend changes.

### Verification

- `[passed] git status --short` - confirmed the case-only rename is tracked.
- `[passed] git diff --check`
- `[not run] application tests and builds` - documentation-only filename and log-format change.

### Deployment

No special deployment steps.

### Git

- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `89e00b0`
- Push: `successful`

### Notes

Historical entries retain their original format; the required structured format applies from this entry onward.
